This Python-based audio modulator performs modulation and demodulation on both custom sinusoidal waves and WAV audio files using techniques like AM and FM. It allows users to input signal parameters or load a WAV file, applies the selected modulation scheme, then demodulates the signal to reconstruct the original. The code also visualizes the original, modulated, and demodulated signals in both time and frequency domains using clear, informative plots.
